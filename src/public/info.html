    <h1>The Global Garden</h1>

    <p>
      The Global Garden is a data-driven visual art and information project that makes the state of our planet visible in an intuitive way.
      Every country in the world is represented by a unique digital flower — its shape, color, and growth pattern are based on real environmental data.
    </p>

    <p>
      All environmental indicators used in Global Garden are derived from the open-access research platform Our World in Data.
      This database compiles reliable statistics from trusted institutions such as the United Nations (UN), the World Bank, the OECD, and peer-reviewed scientific publications.
      The selected indicators, ranging from CO₂ emissions, renewable energy share, water usage, and air pollution, to biodiversity and waste management were carefully chosen to provide a multifaceted picture of ecological sustainability at the country level.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aim is to translate complex sustainability data into a visual, poetic form that sparks awareness and encourages reflection.
      The data is publicly accessible and can be explored in full via the Our World in Data division:
